# python-scripts-gh-actions

After starting a new project:

- we create a venv with this command
`python3 -m venv venv`

- we activate the venv with this command
`. venv/bin/activate`

- then we can install the pip packages we need

- the script needs the requests module, installed with:
`pip install requests`

- to create a file for requirements
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
